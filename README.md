# Krita Plugin: Export current Selection as PNG

Export the current Selection Mask as PNG. The Selection Mask name, width and height will be used for the png file name.

## Project Outlines

The project outlines as described in my blog post about [Open Source Software Collaboration](https://blog.fox21.at/2019/02/21/open-source-software-collaboration.html).

- The main purpose of this software is to export the current selected Selection Mask as flattened png file from [Krita](https://krita.org/en/).
- All main features are covered. Although more features can be possible in the future. 
- This list is open. Feel free to request features.
